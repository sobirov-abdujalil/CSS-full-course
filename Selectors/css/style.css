/* 
CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

/* 
The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
*/
#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
/* 
Note: An id name cannot start with a number!
*/
/* 
The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name
*/
.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
/* 
You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
*/
p.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
/* 
The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
*/
* {
    text-align: center;
    color: blue;
}
/* 
The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):
*/
h1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
  
  h2 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
  
  p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
/* 
It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
*/
h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
/* 
#id	#firstname	Selects the element with id="firstname"
.class	.intro	Selects all elements with class="intro"
element.class	p.intro	Selects only <p> elements with class="intro"
*	*	Selects all elements
element	p	Selects all <p> elements
element,element,..	div, p	Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements
